para: I am nearly done the blog portion of the website, only the information and social links are left to go. This has been fairly easy so far, minimal effort on my part, but I'd like a usable website.

# {title}

<DoubleLineBreak />

<LineBreak />

Contributing to this website, at least in the form of blog posts, should be fairly easy. All you have to do is write a markdown file and recompile the static site for gh pages.

<LineBreak />

I'd praise SvelteKit's ease of use here if so many hadn't before. It was and still is a joy to work with. Sure there were some frustrating moments, but I made it through :)
